h3	Credits
p	zxsp includes the original ZX Spectrum roms. The roms are copyrighted by Amstrad, who has taken over Sinclair Inc.. Fortunately Amstrad has stated publically, that the unmodified ZX Spectrum roms may be distributed with any software emulator of the ZX Spectrum. Thanks to Amstrad!
p	Many keyboard images were created and thus are copyrighted by Andrew Owen. 
p	The z80 emulation was originally based on the z80 engine of fMSX written by Marat Fayzullin. 
p	The ZX80 and ZX81 emulations currently use Paul Farrow's Interface 2 emulator roms.

h1	Download & Installation

h4	Download
p	zxsp, and some related programs can be downloaded from my desktop Mac at <http://k1.spdns.de/zxsp/>. 

h4	Installation
p	<img align="left" src="b/zip.png"> Just double-click the archive and drag the unpacked application where you want.

h4	System Requirements
p	zxsp runs on any Mac with G3 to G5 or Intel x86 processor and Mac OSX 10.x.

p	<img align="left" src="b/macosx.gif"> Version 0.7.1 requires Mac OSX 10.3.9 or higher. 
	Older versions of zxsp which run on older versions of Mac OSX and Mac OS classic are still available from my desktop Mac at <http://k1.spdns.de/zxsp/>. 
	
p	For watching scene demos a graphics card with good OpenGL support is recommended. Poor OpenGL support results in increasing cpu load with increasing screen magnification, while scaling in hardware does not. A good graphics card is more important than a fast processor!
