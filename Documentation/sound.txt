p	<img class="left" src="b/ay.gif"> zxsp does a very good emulation of the AY-3-8912 sound chip and does a good job in resampling the output of the internal beeper.

p	Sound runs smoothly, regardless of processor load and whether zxsp is in the foreground or not. The audio output of all running machines and the tape recorder sum up. Currently (version 0.7.1) sound output is mixed down to mono. This will change.

p	<img class="left" src="b/ay_panel.png"> In the windows menu you find a panel for the AY sound chip. Open it and you can play around with it's registers or just watch what the demo or game is doing. If you want to cancel editing, just enter empty data.

p	The AY clock frequency is set independently from the overall machine throttle or overdrive. The clock edit field accepts plain numbers or numbers with appended unit: 'kHz' or 'MHz'. 

p	The channel A, B and C pitch edit fields set register 0 and 1, 2 and 3 or 4 and 5 respectively. Maximum pitch is 4095. 

p	The noise pitch field sets the noise generator's clock predivider. The noise stage itself exactly reproduces the shift register pseudo random number tingy of the original chip.

p	The <b>mixer control</b> register accepts a string of flags, which are automatically assigned to the proper bits: 'a', 'b' and 'c' enable the noise input, while 'A', 'B' and 'C' enable the frequency input. 'i' and 'o' stand for 'input' and 'output' and set the port A and port B (don't confuse them with channel A and B!) to input or output respectively. They are assigned from left to right, that is, the leftmost 'i' or 'o' is assigned to port A. If no 'i' or 'o' flag is present in your input then the old setting is preserved. Most times you will just edit the displayed flags by deleting or inserting a noise or frequency flag.

p	The channel A, B and C volume fields accept settings from 0 to 31. If you enter a value of 16 or above, then the volume register is set to use the envelope generator.

p	The envelope pitch works similar to the channel A, B C pitch, after predividing the input clock by 16. The envelope pitch counter has 16 valid bits, so all bits of the 2 affected 8 bit registers of the AY chip are used. Valid values are 0 to 65535.

p	The <b>envelope shape</b> register has 4 active bits which indicate hold, toggle, attack and repeat. Actually 8 different patterns are possible. You enter a number in range 0 to 15 and zxsp displays the pattern. You can also enter a pattern with "/", "\", "-" and "_".

p	The I/O ports A is used in some models for peripherals, port B is rarely used and even not connected to pins of the IC used in most machines and 3rd party products. But it is present and can store one byte of data.
