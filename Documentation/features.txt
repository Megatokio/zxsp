p	zxsp currently emulates the original Sinclair models ZX80, ZX81 and the Spectrum family from issue 1 with 16 kB ram to the ZX Spectrum 128 and Amstrads +2 and +2A. In addition, it knows the Spanish and French localised variants and there is initial support for the Timex TC2048 and the Russian Pentagon. Who owns one of the latter machines may kindly talk back to me for testing.

p	zxsp can open multiple instances, which all run simultaneously and produce sound and video output. Sound is superior and runs smooth even on heavy loaded systems. Windows can be zoomed to factor 4 or zxsp can run in fullscreen mode.

p	zxsp loads .sna, .z80, .tap, .80, .81, .o, .p, .tzx, .tzx v1.20, .rom, .ass and .scr files. It saves .sna, .z80, .tap, .80, .81, .o, .p, .rom, .scr and .gif files. It can instant-load .tap, .o, .p, .80 and .81 files and it can load .sna, .tap, .o, .p, .80, .81 files from assembler source.

p	zxsp comes with a built-in virtual tape recorder for loading from and saving to tape files. It can load, save, and dub in any direction between a virtual machine, the built-in virtual tape recorder, and a real-world tape deck or a real-world machine. So you can archive your old tapes or load them back into a real machine.

p	zxsp comes with fully functional virtual keyboards for all models. It supports USB joysticks, which can be plugged into various virtual interfaces. zxsp also emulates the Kempston mouse interface, which uses your mouse. <b>B-)</b>

p	zxsp tries it's best to emulate the inner timing of the simulated machines as accurate as possible for precise screen and border effects in games and scene demos. Timing for the 48k and 128k machines seems to be accurate down to the cycle now, others still need some testers. 

p	zxsp comes with a debugger with register edit for the main chips, a video beam position indicator, single stepper and memory disassembly. The machine can be throttled down to 1 Hz or overdrived to 20 MHz cpu clock. You can directly load Z80 assembler sources into zxsp.

h4	Simulator
p	I call zxsp a 'simulator', because i want it to bring back the original feeling to you. An emulator just enables you to run the old software, while a simulator tries to behave like the simulated machine, which goes much beyond.
