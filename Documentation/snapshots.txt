h1	Snapshots
p	<img src="b/sna.gif"> <img src="b/z80.gif"> <img src="b/rom.gif"> <img src="b/scr.gif"> <img src="b/tap.gif"> zxsp can load and save ".sna" and ".z80" snapshot files, ".rom" rom files and ".scr" screen shots. ".tap" tape files can be loaded "instantly" like a snapshot, if they conform to certain requirements.

h3	.SNA
p	<img src="b/sna.gif" align="left"> ".sna" files are NMI snapshots originally made on real 48k Spectrums. This is the best supported format by any emulator, but it has some draw-backs: First, it can only save a ZX Spectrum 48k snapshot. (16k snapshots are supported by zxsp, but are very rarely used.) It does not contain exact information on the machine, e.g. the PCB issue, which in rare cases may affect the saved game. And, most utterly, it is a NMI snapshot, which means that the program counter PC is stored on the stack in RAM. If the .sna snapshot is taken while the game abused the PC for bitmap copying, then the bitmap is broken or the game may not properly resume after the NMI at all. Therefore .sna snapshots are discouraged for saving.

h3	.Z80
p	 <img src="b/z80.gif" align="left"> ".z80" is an emulator-only format which also supports the later models up to the ZX Spectrum+ 128K, which has 128 kB of paged memory, a sound chip or other hardware. Misc. emulators also save other machines, but this is all non-standard. The .z80 format can optionally store the rom, which is useful to store snapshots of games which included a rom cartridge like 'Shadow of the Unicorn' or when you are working on a modified rom. Non-standard roms are automatically detected and saved to or loaded from a .z80 file.
p	".z80" files can also contain snapshots of ZX Spectrum models which are not yet supported by zxsp. Obviously these snapshots will fail if you try to load them.
p	In version 0.7.1 zxsp added a lot of machine types to the .z80 file format:
pre
    Byte 34     meaning in  meaning in          if byte 37      if byte 29
    (Model)     v2.01       v3.0                bit 7 is set    bit 2 is set

p    (*) denotes the type IDs added by zxsp.


h3	.ROM
p	 <img src="b/rom.gif" align="left"> ".rom" files contain custom roms for different ZX Spectrum models. They can be loaded into the machine to replace the internal rom by double clicking on the rom file or when you select a rom file in the 'open file' dialog. .rom files have different size depending on the model they are saved from. When loading, zxsp tries to load the rom into the frontmost machine, if the rom size fits, else it opens a new machine instance with the most likely ZX Spectrum model for the rom size. 

p	If you want to load a Interface 2 Cartridge, then you should attach the Interface 2 in the 'Items' menu and load the rom into the Interface 2. This way you also get the Sinclair 1 and 2 joystick ports to attach up to 2 USB joysticks.

h3	.SCR
p	 <img src="b/scr.gif" align="left"> ".scr" files contain a dump of the ZX Spectrum video ram. As such they can't be displayed by most graphics programs, just because those don't know about this format. But they can be loaded back into zxsp. When you double-click or select a .scr screenshot in the 'open file' dialog, then the screenshot is either loaded into a new instance or into the frontmost machine, depending on your preferences settings. When loading into a running machine, then only the screen bytes are overwritten, the machine is not halted or reset. Depending on what is currently running, the screen data may be quickly overwritten again by the running programme. 

p	.scr video ram dumps can represent most Specci screenshots including flashing, but there are limitations. First they cannot store screen shots in other screen modes, as present e.g. on the Timex machines. And they can not store high resolution screen effects as shown in scene demos, because those may switch between two screen buffers (on ZX 128k or above) or write to the video ram in a very predicted, frame-synchronized manner to achieve their effects. Also, .scr screen shots do not contain border effects, not even information about the border color for plain single-color borders. If you want to save such effects save a .z80 file instead!

h3	.TAP
h4	Instant loading ".tap" files
	instant load, instant loading, instant load tap, instant loading tap
	instant load tap files, instant loading tap files
p	 <img src="b/tap.gif" align="left"> ".tap" files can either be loaded into the virtual tape recorder, or they can be loaded instantly from the "open…" menu entry like the other snapshot files. For this to work, the programme must only use the rom tape loader routine. If it executes own code to load subsequent data, then the tape loader patch is not triggered and nothing further happens. Such tapes must be loaded with the virtual tape recorder and can be saved as a ".z80" snapshot immediately after loading (use the "Halt CPU after block loaded" option in the "Options" menu) for later instant loading of the game.

p	If the programme has multiple levels or demos, which are loaded subsequently after you are tired with the current one, then the following parts can still be loaded from the initial tape file. It is kept open and positioned at the last recording position waiting for the next call to the rom tape loading routine. Just check the <a href="b/Shock Megademo.tap">Shock Megademo.tap</a> as an example.

h4	Where can you get games
p	Many snapshots for ZX Spectrum can be legally downloaded, because the original copyright holders have allowed us to do so. Some unluckily, did not, so you are required to posess the original games. Take a look at the official ZX Spectrum internet archive <http://www.worldofspectrum.org>.

h4	EDFB level loader
p	The EDFB level loader is no longer supported. I doubt anybody has used it anyway.

h4	Attach AY soundchip to all models
p	You can always attach an AY soundchip on the fly to the running machine by selecting it in the 'Items' menu. There are some demos and games which are saved as '.sna' snapshots which actually play sound on an AY chip. But '.sna' snapshots only store a 48k machine which does not have this chip. So you won't hear anything unless you attach one, either by selecting it from the 'Items' menu or by attaching it by default using the preferences.

h4	Preferences
p	There is a section in the preferences panel for snapshots.

h5	Keyboard mode
p	Selects whether snapshots start up with logical keyboard translation 'by meaning' as for BASIC or with a physical keyboard mapping 'by location' as for games.

h5	Attach AY sound chip to all models
p	You can attach an AY sound chip by default to all loaded snapshots, even if they load into a machine which does not have one. This preference setting is usefull for many demos in '.sna' file format, which try to produce sound using the AY sound chip.

h5	Auto start/stop tape for loading
p	You can enable the autostart feature of the tape recorder for all snapshots by default. Normally this is not very useful for snapshots, because most of them do not load additional data from a .tap file.  

h5	Use remembered settings
p	Instead of using the options as set for all new snapshots you can choose to store and reload those options individually for every snapshot.
