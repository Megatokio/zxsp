h5	Investigations on certain problems:
p	Crashing: Apple's NSLocks just don't work. Maybe because i use the CoreAudio interrupt? I don't know.
p	Cpu usage: cpu usage going up and down w/o reason. This seams to be only virtual, and in real an interference between sampling frequency of the cpu-meter and the interrupt frequency within zxsp. At least i have decided so.
p	Keys not going up: Apple sucks. not only, that i can get keyup events with different character code than in the matching key down event. But additionally under certain reproducible conditions i get no matching keyup event at all. Bug report ID 3903027 submitted. Nothing heared.


//	----------------------------------------------------------------
h3	2004-11-26 - Version 0.6.1
h5	New in this version:
p	Recording to .tap files, tape recorder animation
p	Option for audio playthrough:  -10dB / -30dB / off   (playthrough resulted in loop-back hissing on notebooks)
p	Option: store individual preferences for each snapshot
p	Keyboard: fixed "autorepeat problem": OSX sends keydown and keyup events, which are used to update the ZX Spectrum keymap. But the keycodes passed in the keyup event may differ from those in the preceeding keydown event for the same key, if a modifier key toggled in the meantime. Then the pressed key was not found by my 'keyup' handler and the pressed key stuck forever.
