p	Version 0.7.1 of zxsp introduced the ability to save screenshots in the Gif file format. This is especially nice since the patents on the used lzw algorithm have expired. zxsp creates minimum common denominator Gif files which all programs, incl. open source, freeware and Firefox should understand. Not only Apple's very good impementation since Mac OSX 10.4. 

h4	Gif Screenshots

p	<img class="left" src="../distributions/Screenshots/Echologia-4-3 High color res demo.gif" alt="highres screen from the Ecologia demo."> You can make a screenshot any time either by using the 'Save file' dialogue and saving a file with a name ending on ".gif" or by just pressing 'cmd'+'P', which is especially handy if you are in fullscreen mode. The files saved with 'cmd'+'P' are named automatically and stored on your desktop.

p	<img class="right" src="../distributions/Screenshots/Manic Miner - Loading.gif" alt="flashing attributes used in the Manic Miner load screen"> The gif files saved conserve the full border, all highres colour effects inside the screen and of course the flashing of flashing attributes.

p	<img class="right" src="../distributions/Screenshots/Lazarus animation-1.gif" alt="animation from the Lazarus demo"> Another great feature is the ability of zxsp to record whole sequences of screen animation into a single gif file. But be aware: If large areas are modified at a high speed, then the gif file becomes very quickly very large! But used with thought this is a great feature. You start recording by pressing 'cmd'+'alt'+'P', which works in fullscreen mode too, and stop it by pressing the 'cmd' key again. Or, if you did not release the 'cmd' and 'alt' key, which is somehow very common for me, then you stop recording by hitting the 'P' key again.
