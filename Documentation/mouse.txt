	mouse interface

p	When the ZX Spectrum was launched, the concept of the computer mouse was not yet invented. While the upcoming 16 bit home computers all came with mouse and graphical desktop, the ZX Spectrum was never enhanced this way by Amstrad. But there were some mouse interfaces, frequently bundled with a graphics software, sold by the typical suppliers for ZX Spectrum enhancements.

h3	Kempston Mouse Interface

p	<img src="b/kempston_mouse_if.png" class="left"> As of version 0.7.1 zxsp emulates the Kempston mouse interface. This is technically a very simple interface, the mouse supplies 2 phase shifted square waves, as most mouses at this time did, which are connected to 74LS191 up and down counters. These counters and the mouse buttons can be read via port 64479, 65503 and 64223. 

p	When you select the Kempston mouse interface from the 'Items' menu, the control panel to the left pops up. It shows an image of the interface, the state of the X and Y counters and buttons. You can select a scaling (speed) factor for the emulated mouse, the preset factor of 2:1 is probably best.

h5	Grab mouse

p	But now to the fun part: "Grab mouse". Up to now the mouse interface seems disfunct. After clicking on "Grab mouse" the ZX Spectrum gets control over the mouse, and your Mac loses it. Now you can use the mouse with your ZX Spectrum application but no longer with your Mac. To end this state you simply need to press the 'cmd' key, as is denoted on the "Grab mouse" button while the mouse is grabbed.

p	The Kempston interface contained no Rom with supporting software. So you still see not much difference, except that the Mac mouse pointer vanished and the counters in the interface panel reflect your mouse moving. You need some software to actually use the interface. The zip file of zxsp version 0.7.1 (and probably later) contains a sample programme by Chris Cowley. You can use and modify it to do a useful job.

p	If you have some games or tools which use the Kempston mouse interface (or others), then it would be nice if you could just tell me the name or link or or send me a tape or snapshot file.

h6	Grab mouse summary:
ul
li Load a snapshot file which supports the mouse interface.
li Attach the interface to the Specci by selecting it from the 'Items' menu.
li Klick on the "Grab mouse" button.
li The button label changes to "CMD to exit": the mouse is grabbed for the Specci until you press the command key.

h5	Grab mouse in fullscreen mode

p	The mouse is automatically grabbed when zxsp enters fullscreen mode and a mouse interface is attached to the frontmost Specci. Grabbing it beforehand by klicking "Grab mouse" does not hurt, but when you press 'cmd'+'F' to enter fullscreen mode then you press the command key. So it's good idea that zxsp grabs the mouse for you.

p	If you have only one monitor then the grab is only released when you leave fullscreen mode.

p	If you have 2 or more monitors then the grab is still released when you press the command key, so that you can maneuvre on the other monitor. You can grab the mouse again by klicking on the "Grab mouse" button, except if the Kempston mouse interface panel is obscured by the fullscreen display. So move it to the other display before you enter fullscreen mode.

p	If you have enabled "Remember settings & use remembered settings" in the preferences panel for known snapshots, then the mouse interface is automatically attached next time you start this snapshot file.

p	Some aspects of the implementation are painful but required for OS X 10.3.9 compatibility. If you encounter problems with the mouse handling in zxsp then send in a bug report!
