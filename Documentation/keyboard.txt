h4	Virtual keyboards
p.c	<img src="b/keyboards.png">
p	zxsp comes with virtual keyboards for all supported machines. Some of the images were gratefully supplied by Andrew Owen.
p	The keyboards show each key pressed on the virtual machine while you type on your real keyboard. Sometimes one keypress is transposed into two keys pressed on the ZX keyboard, e.g. if you press 'cursor left' on your real keyboard this results in <img src="b/capsshift.gif"> plus <img src="b/5.gif"> going down on the ZX Spectrum. This way living is a little more easy for you.


h4	Modifier keys
	modifiers

p	Modifier keys are keys which do not generate a key by their own, but rather modify the key generated by other keys. The modifier keys of the Mac OSX keyboard are mapped to the ZX computer keyboards as follows: 

h5	ZX80
p	<img src="b/SHIFT_ZX80.gif">: &nbsp; 'shift', 'alt' and 'control' on your real-world keyboard are all mapped to the "SHIFT" key.
	<img src="b/SHIFT_ZX80.gif"> <img src="b/NEWLINE_ZX80.gif">: &nbsp; 'esc' is mapped to "SHIFT" + "NEWLINE", which results in the 'edit line' command in Basic.
	
h5	ZX81
p	<img src="b/SHIFT_ZX81.gif">: &nbsp; 'shift', 'alt' and 'control' are all mapped to "SHIFT".
	<img src="b/SHIFT_ZX81.gif"> <img src="b/NEWLINE_ZX81.gif">: &nbsp; 'esc' is mapped to "SHIFT" + "NEWLINE", which which enters 'function mode' in Basic.

h5	ZX Spectrum
p	<img src="b/capsshift.gif">: &nbsp; the 'shift' key or the 'alt' key on your real-world keyboard both press "CAPS SHIFT" on the ZX Spectrum computer.
	<img src="b/symbolshift.gif">: &nbsp; 'control' presses the "SYMBOL SHIFT" key.
	<img src="b/capsshift.gif"> <img src="b/symbolshift.gif">: &nbsp; 'esc' is mapped to "CAPS SHIFT" + "SYMBOL SHIFT", which enters 'extended mode' in Basic.

h5	Sticky keys
	sticky
p	The modifier keys are sticky on the virtual keyboard. That is, if you klick on them with your mouse pointer then they stay down until another key is pressed and goes up. This allows you to work with the mouse only on the virtual keyboard. On the other hand you can also use real keyboard and the virtual keyboard simultaneously. Hold down the 'shift' key on the real keyboard and klick on a key on the virtual keyboard image. It just works.

h4	Basic and Game mode
	game mode, game keyboard mode
p	You can select between two keyboard translation modes, one for Basic, which does a mapping 'by meaning', and one for games, which does a mapping 'by location'.
p	There is a menu option to toggle between Basic and Game mode and there is also a preference setting for new machines.

h5	Basic mode
	basic keyboard mode
p	On some national keyboards keys are swapped, e.g. 'Y' and 'Z' on the German keyboard. Also the ZX Spectrum typically shifts symbol letters with <img src="b/symbolshift.gif"> and not <img src="b/capsshift.gif">. So in Game mode you get the double quotes on <img src="b/p.gif"> with the corresponding keys on your keyboard, that is 'control' and 'P', but in Basic mode you get them as usual, that is using 'shift' plus '2'. Just have a look at your keyboard and the Specci keyboard to notice the difference. And when you press 'shift' plus '2' in Basic mode you can actually see that <img src="b/symbolshift.gif"> and <img src="b/p.gif"> are going down on the virtual keyboard.
p	In Basic mode it is sometimes hard to get those key combinations from the original ZX Spectrum which involved pressing <img src="b/capsshift.gif"> plus a number key <img src="b/1.gif"> to <img src="b/0.gif"> from the top row. This is simply because if you press 'shift' plus a number key, this results in a character from '!' to '=' and this is mapped in Basic mode by meaning to the corresponding <img src="b/symbolshift.gif"> combinations. So you can't press 'shift' plus '1' to get <img src="b/capsshift.gif"> + <img src="b/1.gif"> for EDIT. Therefore the 'alt' key on your keyboard also works as an auxilliary <img src="b/capsshift.gif">. 

h4	Ghost keys
p	The keys on the ZX computer keyboard are aranged in a 5 x 8 matrix, formed by row and column wires. If you press 3 keys which form the corners of a rectange, that is, two are in the same row and two are in the same column, then they short circuit the electrical connection for the 4th key of this rectangle. When the machine reads the keyboard, it will see that this 4th key is also down, though it is actually not pressed. This effect is simulated in zxsp.
