/*	Helper class that automates reference counting for CFTypes.
    After constructing the CFType object, it can be copied like a value-based type.

    based on Qt/.../QtSerialPort/private/qcore_mac_p.h

    Note that you must own the object you are wrapping.
    This is typically the case if you get the object from a Core Foundation function
    with the word "Create" or "Copy" in it. If you got the object from a "Get" function,
    either retain it or use constructFromGet(). One exception to this rule is the
    HIThemeGet*Shape functions, which in reality are "Copy" functions.
