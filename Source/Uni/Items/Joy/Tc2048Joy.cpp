http://8bit.yarek.pl/computer/zx.tc2048/index-de.html:

	In Timex Computer 2048 ULA is seen only in #FE port.
	Other ports used are #F4 (memory switching, not used in TC2048),
	#FF (screen mode, memory switching and interrupts disable) and Kempston Joystick interface.
	And the Kempston Joystick interface is the problem here, as is decoded only with line A5=0.
	So you have to read joystick in ports 0..31, 64..95, 128..160 and 192..224.
	This gives conflict with many external devices and there's no way to disable the input port without internal changes.
	(There are also #F5 and #F6 ports decoded for AY-3-8912, but since no device is connected to decoding lines, they don't make any problem.)

	address:	%xxxx.xxxx.xx0x.xxxx
	data byte:	%000FUDLR active high

	state of unused bits is not clear.

	there is a drawing by yarek.com for a TC2048 kempston joystick port,
	but this probably only addresses the problem of inverted inputs (shorting to +5V)
	which does not work with auto fire joysticks.
