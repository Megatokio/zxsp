	Z80 Emulator
	based on fMSX; Copyright (C) Marat Fayzullin 1994,1995

	CB instruction handlers


note:
this is the 'compact version' which fit's in a 32k code segment for 68020 version
and which is faster than a case construct with 256 distinct handlers on a PowerPC,
probably due to more cache hits. Therefore i have removed the version with the 256
handlers on 19.Nov.1995. KIO !


timing:
	all register operations take 8 T cycles:  pc:4, pc+1:4
	bit test operations (hl):				  pc:4, pc+1:4, hl:3,1
	shift and bit set/clear (hl):			  pc:4, pc+1:4, hl:3,1, hl:3
