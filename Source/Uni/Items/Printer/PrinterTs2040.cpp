//  Timex TS2040  /  Alphacom 32 Printer
//  ------------------------------------



//    WoS:
//    Peripheral: Timex TS2040 / Alphacom 32 Printers.
//    Port: ---- ---- 1111 1011

//    The TS2040 is wired as a z80 I/O port, selected by A2 being at low level and A7 being at high level. No other address lines are recognised. To send information to the printer, use: OUT (FB), A - opcode D3 FB, assuming the data is in register A. The data bits have the following meanings:

//        (D2) High level means stop the motor, low means start it.
//        (D7) High level applies power to the print head.

//    All these lines remain in the state they were last at, until new data is sent to the printer. At switch on, or after pressing the feed button, D7 is set low; D2 is left high once feed is finished. The other data lines are not used.

//    To fetch information from the printer, the z80 instruction: IN A, (FB) - opcode DB FB; will put the data into the accumulator. The following bits are used:

//        (D6) Will be read as low if the printer is there, high if it is not, and is used solely to check if the printer is connected.
//        (D0) This is high when the printer is ready for the next bit.
//        (D7) This line is high for the start of a new line.
