//    Wos:
//    Peripheral: ZX Printer.
//    Port: ---- ---- ---- -0--
//
//  The ZX Printer is addressed in the same way as the Alphacom 32 and Timex TS2040, with the following notes:
//    D0 and D7 are both latched so that they remain high until the computer writes something to the printer. So even if you don't make use of the information you've read in, you should output an instruction (with appropriate data) to reset the latches until the next signal. These bits may be in either state on switch on, and aren't affected by the feed button.
//    The paper detect signal is also used internally by the printer to make sure that the styli stop off the paper. Note that if power is applied to the stylus, the paper signal will go high even if the printer is between scans, so the stylus must be turned off before attempting to detect the edge of the paper.
