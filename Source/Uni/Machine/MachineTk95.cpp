/* A later model, the TK-95, which boasted an improved keyboard
   (similar to the Commodore 64's) and a more compatible ROM,
   was little more than a Timex TC2048 (another Spectrum
   clone) in disguise.

wikipedia:
	The TK90X was replaced by the TK95, which had a different keyboard (professional)
	and case (identical to Commodore Plus4) and exactly the same circuit board and schematics.
	The motherboard was marked as TK90X.

kio: so i believe this TK90X info also applies:
	the TV system was hardware selectable to PAL-M (60 Hz) as used in Brazil,
	PAL-N (50 Hz) as used in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay
	and NTSC (60 Hz) as used in USA and many other countries.
