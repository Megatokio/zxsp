/*	class TzxData
	-------------

	Subclass of "TapeData".

	A "TzxData" instance contains data from a .tzx file or converted to .tzx file format.
	Typically a "TzxData" instance contains only one "TzxBlock",
	but blocks grouped with block 0x21 are stored in one "TzxData" block
	and blocks which do not end with a pause are concatenated as well.

	As all TapeData classes TzxData defines or implements conversion creators for CswBuffer:
	- new TzxData(CswBuffer const&) and
	- new CswBuffer(TzxData const&, uint32 ccps).

	And static file i/o methods:
	readFile (cstr fpath, TapeFile&) and writeFile (cstr fpath, TapeFile&)
