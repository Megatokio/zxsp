	---------------

	Subclass of "TapeData".

	Mono or stereo audio data block

	A "AudioData" instance contains data from an audio file or
	from CswBuffer or other TapeData classes converted to audio samples.
	A "AudioData" instance contains one data block.

	As all TapeData classes AudioData defines or implements conversion creators for CswBuffer:
	- new AudioData(CswBuffer const&) and
	- new CswBuffer(AudioData const&, uint32 ccps).

	And static file i/o methods:
	readFile (cstr fpath, TapeFile&) and writeFile (cstr fpath, TapeFile&)

	Framework	AudioToolbox/AudioToolbox.h
	Declared in	AudioToolbox/AudioFile.h
